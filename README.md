## Introduction

The project titled "Leveraging GPT Models to Enhance Federal Grant Data" explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of datasets concerning federal grants.

**Datasets:** [Organizations Data](https://github.com/KrishnaTejaJ/p-llm-funding/tree/main/data)

---

## Organizations Affiliation with NSF

We use a Python script to filter and analyze data for potential NSF affiliations. This analysis focuses on string filtering methods within a dataset of 10,000 organization names.

**Script:** [NSF String Filter Script](https://github.com/KrishnaTejaJ/p-llm-funding/blob/main/Code/nsf_string_filter.ipynb)

## Exploring Organizational Affiliations with NSA Using GPT Models

This section evaluates the effectiveness of various GPT models in identifying organizational affiliations with the NSA. Models such as ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus were tested.

**Detailed Analysis:** [Project Repository](https://github.com/KrishnaTejaJ/p-llm-funding/tree/main/Prompts)

## Geographical Aspect in Organizational Affiliations

An analysis of the geographical distribution of organizations affiliated with NSF, highlighting the global impact and potential areas for increased diversity in funding.

## Future Scope

Future work will explore other GPT models and the development of real-time tools for pattern detection and interactive dashboards for policymakers.

---

## Conclusion

This study demonstrated the utility of GPT models in analyzing data from federal grant databases, showing significant potential for enhancing research funding strategies.
